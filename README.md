# SMS_Text_Classification

In this project I created a spam or ham text classification model using LSTM.

1. After importing the datasets, I encoded the categorical columns.
2. Then I used ```nltk``` or Natural Language Toolkit along with ```re``` or Regular Expression to preprocess the incoming text.
3. The model consists of one ```Input``` Layer, one ```Embedding``` Layer, one ```LSTM``` Layer, two ```Dense``` Layer and one ```Dropout``` Layer.

Finally the loss and accuracy graphs were plotted along with a function to check if the given text is SPAM or HAM and what percentage.
